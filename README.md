# Data Strucures and Algorithms
This is a compilation/personal library of all the codes for the data structures and algorithms I have learned and created throughout my college course CIS 2101 - Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Setup
To test a header file, add the following code to the beginning of file of the driver program **main.cpp**:
```c
#include "./FOLDER-NAME/HEADER-FILE-NAME.h"

Example:
#include "./Stacks/stackArray.h"
```
